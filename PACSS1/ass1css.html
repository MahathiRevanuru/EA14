    <h2><i>What is CSS</i></h2>
<ol class="one">
    <li>
        CSS stands for cascading style sheets</li><br>
    <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on the screen,paper, or in other media</li><br>
    <li><font style="text-decoration-line:line-through;">CSS is not necessary</font> <span class="two"> <b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span>It can control the layout of multiple webpages all at once</li><br>
    <li> <i><u>External style sheets are stored in CSS files.</u></i></li>
 </ol>


    <h2><I>CSS can be add to HTML document in 3 ways:</I></h2>
 <ul class="mahathi">

        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li><br>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li><br>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li><br>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class="two"> <b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b> </span> because this is esaier to demonstrate , and easier for you to try it  yourself</li>
    </ul>
  <p>
    when comparing CSS class vs Id, the difference is that css class applies style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies style to unique element.ID is also  special in that you can use a special url to link directly to an element and it's used by javascript.
  </p>  
        <p>
            In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements  on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
        </p>
<p>
    There is a wide range of seletors available. Two of the mostl commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
